# RP2040temperatureLoggerCDC
use a Waveshare RP2040one board, an NTC and a resistor to build a simple temperature logger

By default it outputs the temperature in Â°C every second on the virtual COM port (CDC).
You can send a decimal number followed by NEWLINE to set the measurement interval in seconds.
You can turn off the automatic logging by setting the interval to ZERO.
You can trigger a measurement by sending "!" followed by NEWLINE.
If you send "." followed by NEWLINE, you get the internal RP2040 chip temperature.

You may use more than one RP2040-one connected to your computer. You can distinguish the
boards by using their serial number. Have a look to the boot_out.txt file that is automatically
generated by CircuitPython in the mass storage drive. With this information you can set up
a udev rule to specifiy a dedicated interface for each board.

Note: I was not able to use the RP2040-one CDC as a COM port on Windows10. If anyone knows
      a trick to convince Windoof to open the COM port, please drop me a note.
